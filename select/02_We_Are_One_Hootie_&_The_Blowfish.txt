We are one, you and I, we don't even have to try
It's supposed to be this way
Like a sun shining light in the middle of the night
Girl, you brighten up my day
We are one, you and I, like the color of the sky
When the clouds are blown away
So much fun, you and I, we don't need a reason why
And together we will stay

And oh, it's magic
When a chill is running down my spine
Here we are (we are one, you and I)
Oh, yeah, here we are (we are one, you and I)
Here we are, where no one else can ever be
I am apart of you and you're part of me

We are one, you and I, to the left or to the right
Meet you somewhere in between
Like a child whose eyes never noticed black and white
'Cause it's all they've ever seen
We are one, you and I, up until the day we die
And forever on it goes
So much fun, you and I, let your soul and spirit fly
Where we end up no one knows

And oh, it's magic
When a chill is running down my spine
Here we are (we are one, you and I)
Oh, yeah, here we are (we are one, you and I)
Yeah, yeah, here we are where no one else can ever be
Yeah, I am apart of you, you're part of me
We are one, you and I
