Who we are, we are, we are (we are)
That's who we are, we are, we are, we are
Ooh

I know you got a feelin' in the mornin'
So I don't wanna waste your time now
Baby, come with me and get high now
Burn two trees and I'm right out
And I know it was just timin'
For you to be right where I'm at
I needed you to say

And now you're givin' a good reason to believe in love
Take a real good look, and you'll see, it's us
But you, don't believe in us
But you won't let go

'Cause the first thing I saw was you (was you)
And I know you got your eyes on me (on me)
But to think you still keep running back
I know you took a chance on me
And I know I wanna get on you (on you)
And I know you wanna get on me
I got visions of us running back
I know you're right here with me

Take time with me, baby, you'll find out
And you can have the time of your life (your life)
If I was you, I wouldn't play around
'Cause I know the things you like
And if you don't wanna act on it right now, baby
I wanna live my life
But everything is fine when your hands on me

Good reason to believe in love
Take a real good look, and you'll see, it's us
But you, don't believe in us
But you won't let go

'Cause the first thing I saw was you (was you)
And I know you got your eyes on me (on me)
But to think you still keep running back
I know you took a chance on me
And I know I wanna get on you (on you)
And I know you wanna get on me
I got visions of us running back
I know you're right here with me

'Cause the first thing I saw was you (was you)
And I know you got your eyes on me (on me)
But to think you still keep running back
I know you took a chance on me

Who we are, we are, we are
That's who we are, we are, we are, we are
That's who we are
That's who we are, we are

'Cause the first thing I saw was you (was you)
And I know you got your eyes on me (on me)
But to think you still keep running back
I know you took a chance on me
And I know I wanna get on you (on you)
And I know you wanna get on me
I got visions of us running back
I know you're right here with me

That's who we are, we are
That's who we are, we are
