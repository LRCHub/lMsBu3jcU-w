[00:00.41] I've paid my dues time after time
[00:07.19] I've done my sentence but committed no crime
[00:15.05] And bad mistakes, I've made a few
[00:23.02] I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
[00:25.94] But I've come through
[00:36.44] 
[00:28.42] And we mean to go on, and on, and on, and on
[00:50.42] 
[00:33.18] We are the champions, my friends
[00:40.50] And we'll keep on fighting till the end
[00:48.50] We are the champions, we are the champions
[00:56.09] No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the world
[01:26.09] 
[01:16.03] I've taken my bows and my curtain calls
[01:23.73] You brought me fame and fortune
[01:26.08] And everything that goes with it, I thank you all
[01:50.58] 
[01:30.46] But it's been no bed of roses, no pleasure cruise
[01:38.74] I consider it a challenge before
[01:40.60] The whole human race and I ain't gonna lose
[02:02.10] 
[01:44.99] And we mean to go on, and on, and on and on
[02:06.49] 
[01:49.53] We are the champions, my friends
[01:56.89] And we'll keep on fighting till the end
[02:04.95] We are the champions, we are the champions
[02:12.32] No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the world
[02:42.32] 
[02:22.12] We are the champions, my friends
[02:28.42] And we'll keep on fighting till the end, oh
[02:36.50] We are the champions, we are the champions
[02:43.88] No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions
